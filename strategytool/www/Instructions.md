# Systems Mapping User Guide

### Introduction

This is a visualisation tool aiming to bring an understanding of the interrelationships between variables in a system. It allows users to investigate how other variables in the system are impacted when changes occur in a particular area. The tool can be useful in communicating across multiple teams working on inter-connected problems. This will help to ensure we design policy to maximise benefits, account for dependencies, mitigate conflicting interests and take account of learning as we go. It will help reduce the risk of unintended consequences, ensuring individual decisions do not end up hindering it or other important objectives.

The tool aims to help you to:

- work through the interdependencies and trade-offs that you will need to make,
- be informed of your policy options,
- give you a deeper assessment of cross-cutting challenges, and
- identify and prioritise if you need to complete further analysis and or research on the policies that you are looking to enact.

The tool should help empower you to reach out, collaborate, and visualise the impact of the policies that you will be enacting.

### Using the tool

You should see two tabs at the top of this page:

1.	User Guide, which you are currently viewing and explains how to navigate and use this app.
2.	App, which takes you to the main tool

Within the main tool, you will first need to select a map to view. If you have a map file, click browse and select the map file within the Windows File Explorer box that opens up.

If you don't already have a map file, you can instead click "Show example map". You can [download the example map file here](dummy_system.xlsx) to see how the map files are formatted, and what information needs to be included.

When you first open a map, the view defaults to an overview. Either click on the map, or click the name of the system on the left, below "Overview". Four different viewing tools are shown at the top, of which one the first, "Diagram View", is immediately available. This view allows you to explore the map. The other available views are:
	- Impacts as a List, which appears when you increase a variable and make a change to the map. This visualizes the changes to the system in a report format.
	- Feedback Loops, which appears when a change is made to the map that kickstarts a feedback loop. This visualizes the feedback loops resulting from any changes the user has made to the system.
	- Theories of Change, which appears when you make a variable the ‘target’ by clicking on the target symbol on the right-hand side of a variable. This shows the upstream levers and opportunities to make impact on the ‘target’ variable.

There are a couple of ways to approach the use of the tool:

1. Filter the map to the variable you wish to examine by double-clicking on that variable. The immediate relationships to this variable will be shown. This can be increased to include the 2nd step of relationships (i.e. Not only those variables that influence the chosen variable but also the variables that influence those). This can be increased up to the 5th step.
2. You can filter by subgroup by clicking on the sub-systems key on the left-hand side of the screen.
3. To make a change to the system, click at the top or the bottom of a variable to increase or decrease that variable respectively.

### Definitions

- Variables - These are the individual building blocks within a system and are something that can vary over time.
- **Same** Causal Relationships - Relationships are shown as the same where an increase in one variable would lead to an increase in the other variable also, and vice versa. If A increases, then B increases. If A decreases, then B decreases.
- **Opposite** Causal Relationships - Relationships are shown as the opposite where an increase in one variable would lead to a decrease in the other variable and vice versa. If A increases, then B decreases. If A decreases, then B increases.
- Reinforcing Feedback Loops - This is where the causal relationships within a loop create exponential growth or collapse. This is where an initial change to a variable creates further change to that same variable, resulting in more pronounced growth or decline over time.
- Balancing Feedback Loops - This is where the causal relationships in the loop keep things in equilibrium, or in balance. These loops counter a change with a push in the opposite direction.  The harder the push, the harder the system pushes back.

### Caveats

The tool is intended to be used to explore the connections within the system and highlight potential impacts or influences, not to provide exact quantitative answers. For more specific answers we recommend engaging with the appropriate analytical team.
